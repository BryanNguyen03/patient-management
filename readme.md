A Project to help me learn AWS infrastructure and Kafka.

This backend project utilizes:
- Springboot for the microservices
- gRPC for communication between services
- Kafka for 1-to-many microservice communication
- Docker to containerize while developing
- AWS services and LocalStack for deployment.

Overall, I learned quite a few things:
1. gRPC for internal micro-service communication
2. Kafka architecture with producer/consumers, topics, and brokers
3. Gained a better understanding of API Gateway benefits including load balancing using ECS fargate service
4. Understanding of AWS services like ECS, RDS, MSK
